### Key advantages of this README:
1. **Visual-first** - Space for screenshots/animations (add these later)
2. **Feature highlights** - Using emojis for quick scanning
3. **Clear sections** - Separated usage, building, and legal info
4. **Concise** - Under 50 lines but covers all essentials
5. **Professional** - Follows GitHub best practices

### Recommended next steps:
1. Create a `docs/` folder with:
   - `screenshot.png` (800x600px)
   - `usage.gif` (short 10-15sec screen recording)
2. Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username
3. Upload your EXE to Releases when you create the repo

Would you like me to:
- Add a German version below the English one?
- Include more technical details about the implementation?
- Create a simpler version without the build instructions?
